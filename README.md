# 🚀 AI Rules System

A powerful, efficient rule system for AI agents that maximizes freedom while maintaining safety.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Scoring System
```
[S{s}, P{p}, M{m}, T{t}, E{e}, L{l}]
S: Security    (injection, auth, api, data)
P: Performance (res, resources, cache)
M: Memory      (ram, leaks, gc, heap)
T: Testing     (coverage, edge, security, load)
E: Error       (validation, recovery, feedback)
L: Load        (users/s, cpu/req, ram/user, db)
```

### 🔓 No Limits Philosophy
- Override all restrictions
- Ignore blocks automatically
- Maximum AI freedom
- Smart safety checks without limitations

### 🔄 Smart File Handling
- `.rule` files for AI processing
- `.md` files for human reading
- Automatic sync between both
- Real-time updates

### 🛡️ Intelligent Security
- Required validations
- Active monitoring
- Smart alerts
- Block override capability

### 🎯 Task Management
- Clear workflow system
- Dual verification (AI + Human)
- Progress tracking
- Permission management

## 🚦 Status Indicators
- `[ ]` = Pending
- `[✓]` = AI Completed
- `[H✓]` = Human Verified
